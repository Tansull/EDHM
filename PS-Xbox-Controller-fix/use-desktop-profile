I use the mod and a steam controller, never had issues. I do use the desktop profile though as it's the only way I got the controller working with VR.

How do you activate the 'desktop profile'? 

Steam/Settings/Controller. From there you can set the desktop configuration. 
If it's some fancy configuration it's best to make it as a game profile first, save it, 
and then load it as desktop config. 

Don't change anything on the profile in the desktop configuration as some parts get omitted or cut. 
I don't use big picture, wherefore I don't know if 3dmigoto works with it.
