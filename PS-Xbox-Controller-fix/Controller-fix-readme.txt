Some CMDRs have reported their PS or Xbox controller doesn't work with the mod.

This often occurs when Steam overlay is activated and managing the controller (the mod is not compatible with Steam overlay)

There are three fixes:

i. Force Steam to not manage the controller
ii. Load Elite without Steam
iii. Use the 'desktop profile' with Steam

These fixes are explained in this folder.

Please note: Not everyone experiences a conflict between their controller and the mod
