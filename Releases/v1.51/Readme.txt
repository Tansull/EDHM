Welcome to EDHM v1.51!

Please ensure you read the EDHM v1.51 Manual (or at least the Installation instructions) before installing EDHM.

If you are updating from v1.5 then please backup to a different folder any .ini files you have modified. All .ini files are compatible across versions.

I recommend running the EDHM-Uninstall.bat on v1.5 before installing v1.51, as many changes have been made to the shaders.
