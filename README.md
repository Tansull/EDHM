# EDHM
## **Elite Dangerous HUD Mod**

For a full description of the mod, please see the post on the [official Frontier forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-hud-mod-edhm.557033/)

### Odyssey
I'm very pleased to announce EDHM for Odyssey is now available. Unlike the Horizons version of EDHM, you can set custom RGB colours for every element on the HUD, and ship / station / carrier panels.

In EDHM for Odyssey v8.3 you can now customise the Suit HUD (on-foot). Thanks to CMDR Mystler for modding the Suit HUD!

Due to the complexity of the Odyssey version, I recommend you use EDHM UI (developed by Blue Mystic) to install and configure the mod

[EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

Please note: EDHM UI will install both the mod **and** the UI, you don't need to download anything else.

As EDHM for Odyssey is still in development, I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support

### Horizons

Latest version for Horizons: 1.51 (March 31, 2021)

[v1.51 Download Link](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/releases/tag/v1.5)

If you prefer not to configure the mod manually (in a text editor) then please use [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

EDHM for Horizons is no longer being developed as I don't have time to work on both versions. However, it's still a good mod with lots of options.
