## **Elite Dangerous HUD Mod**

**ALERT:** EDHM for Odyssey now works in Horizons 4.0! Please see the notes on the [Elite forums thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-hud-mod-edhm.557033/post-9946713)

### Odyssey
I'm very pleased to announce EDHM for Odyssey is now available. Unlike the Horizons version of EDHM, you can set custom RGB colours for every element on the HUD, and ship / station / carrier panels.

Due to the complexity of the Odyssey version, I recommend you use EDHM UI (developed by Blue Mystic) to install and configure the mod

Please note: EDHM UI will install both the mod **and** the UI, you don't need to download anything else.

As EDHM for Odyssey is still in development, I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support

### Horizons 3.8

Latest version for Horizons 3.8: v1.52b (December 26, 2021)

[v1.52b Download Link](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/tree/main/Releases/v1.52)

If you prefer not to configure the mod manually (in a text editor) then please use [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

EDHM for Horizons 3.8 is no longer being developed as I don't have time to work on both versions. However, it's still a good mod with lots of options.
