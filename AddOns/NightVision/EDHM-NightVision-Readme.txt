There are two versions of this AddOn

i. A 'Standard' version with the same shading as the original Elite night vision

ii. A 'Tron-like' version with a darker base-background, and brighter main lines

Full instructions to change the colours are within the shader files (open with a text editor such as Notepad++)

To install the Night Vision mod, copy one of the Night Vision shaders (Standard or Tron) into the ShaderFixes folder
