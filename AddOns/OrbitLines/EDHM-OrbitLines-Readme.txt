This AddOn allows you to change the colour of the Orbit Lines.

Also, you can adjust the colour of the planetary orbit lines separately to the gravity well lines.

Please see this post on the Elite forums for details:

Full instructions to change the colours are within the shader file (open with a text editor such as Notepad++).

To install the Orbit Lines mod, copy the Orbit Lines shader into the ShaderFixes folder.
