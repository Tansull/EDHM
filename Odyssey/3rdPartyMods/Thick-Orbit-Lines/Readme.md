# Thick Orbit Lines Mod v1.17.1 for Odyssey FDev Update 17.01 (includes Fix for AMD Graphics Card by MrVaad)

**:: Release Notes ::**
- Ready for FDev U17.01

- Added a fix for orbit lines for Linux users with an AMD RX6000 series by MrVaad

Ever wanted to make your orbit lines thicc? 

With this 3PM you can increase the glow and width of your orbit / gravity well / exclusion zone lines (in addition to setting their colour and brightness in the main mod)

The effect applies to all types of lines (orbit, gravity well, exclusion zone) as they can't be separated in this particular shader

Please note: FDev never intended for the orbit lines to be stretched, so they have a crosshatch pattern in the middle - it's not a bug, it's a feature ðŸ™‚

Have fun! o7
