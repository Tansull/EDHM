# 3rd-party Mods

3rd-party mods (3PMs) for Odyssey are optional extra mods. You must have EDHM for Odyssey installed prior to installing 3PMs.

Current 3PMs available:
- FSS Overlay (Compatible with U15.02)
- Enhanced Biome Overlay (Fixed for FDev U15.02)
- Fuel Scooping Stars Mod (Compatible with U15.02)
- No Holograms Mod (Compatible with U15.02)
- Thick Orbit Lines (Compatible with U15.02)

In development:
- Cockpit Paint Mod (not compatible with FDev U15.02)


## To install 3PMs

3PM zip files are located in this GitHub folder

**With [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases) (recommended):**
- Exit Elite
- Download the 3PM ZIP file and save it anywhere you want
- In EDHM UI go to 'Main Menu -> 3PMods'
- At the bottom toolbar, click 'Import Mod' and select the ZIP you downloaded
- Configure via the UI

**Manually (only if you understand the structure of the mod):**
 - Exit Elite
 - Save the zip file in the game folder (usually elite-dangerous-odyssey-64)
 - Ensure the 'ShaderFixes' and 'EDHM-ini' folders exist in the game folder (where you saved the zip file). They are the mod folders, if you don't see them you're in the wrong folder.
 - Unzip the contents, and press 'ok' to merge existing folders, overwrite old files
 - Configure via the .ini files in the EDHM-ini/3rdPartyMods folder
 - Uninstall by double-clicking the corresponding .bat file (for example, 'CockpitLights.bat') in the EDHM-ini/3rdPartyMods folder (make sure Elite is closed!)

For support with 3PMs, please join the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) as I cannot provide support here, thanks
