# 3rd-party Mods

3rd-party mods (3PMs) for Odyssey are optional extra mods in the alpha stages of testing. Once they are confirmed working without bugs they will be incorporated into the main mod. You must have EDHM for Odyssey installed prior to installing 3PMs.

### Cockpit Lights v3.21 by psychicEgg

The Cockpit Lights mod has been updated from v3.2 to v3.21 to add a missing texture from the T9/T10 dashboard lights. 

If you have a previous version of the Cockpit Lights mod installed, please uninstall it first before installing this new version (make sure you've exited and closed Elite before uninstalling/installing)

**PLEASE NOTE BEFORE DOWNLOADING:**

The modding software can't extract a few of the lighting accessory shaders correctly.
As a result, the Cockpit Lights mod will turn off the glow on some ARX lighting (such as the Ancient Orb lights, Skull lights, and I think the Pumpkin), so please keep that in mind before downloading. 
Not all ARX lights are affected. If you uninstall this CockpitLights mod then the affected ARX lights will turn back on again.

This mod is separate from the Cabin Lighting (ambient lighting) and affects the accessory lights around the cockpit on the following ships:

**Krait MkII & Phantom**
 - option to turn off the upper front lights, probably the most annoying lights in Elite
 - option to turn off front, overhead and floor lights

**AspX & Scout**
 - option to turn off the front side lights
 - option to turn off side lights plus floor and overhead lights

**Corvette**
 - Customise the bright light wells at the front, or just reduce brightness (or remove the bulb completely)
 - Turn off the bright white lights under the dashboard
 - Turn down the brightness of the Core Dynamics logo at the front
 - Add a matte cover to the insanely bright metal plate under the Core Dynamics logo

**Anaconda**
 - Customise the colour of the overhead lights and a few elements around the radar

**Imperial ships**
 - Customise the blue stripe lighting

**Cutter**
 - Customise the accessory dials, lights and logo on the dashboard

**Chieftain / Challenger**
- Option to turn off the small white lights on the cockpit frame 

**Dolphin and Type 9 / Type 10**
 - Dim the accessory lights on the dashboard, or make them grey

## To install 3PMs

3PM zip files are located in this GitHub folder

**With [EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases) (recommended):**
- Exit Elite
- Download the 3PM ZIP file and save it anywhere you want
- In EDHM UI go to 'Main Menu -> 3PMods'
- At the bottom toolbar, click 'Import Mod' and select the ZIP you downloaded
- Configure via the UI

**Manually (only if you understand the structure of the mod):**
 - Exit Elite
 - Save the zip file in the game folder (usually elite-dangerous-odyssey-64)
 - Ensure the 'ShaderFixes' and 'EDHM-ini' folders exist in the game folder (where you saved the zip file). They are the mod folders, if you don't see them you're in the wrong folder.
 - Unzip the contents, and press 'ok' to merge existing folders, overwrite old files
 - Configure via the .ini files in the EDHM-ini/3rdPartyMods folder
 - Uninstall by double-clicking 'CockpitLights.bat' in the EDHM-ini/3rdPartyMods folder (make sure Elite is closed!)
