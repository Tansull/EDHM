# Clean Screenshot Mod v1.15.10 for Elite Dangerous 4.0 Update 15.02  (ex No Holograms Mod)

### by CMDR Fred89210<br><br>

**The mod changes its name to *'Clean Screenshot Mod'* in order to be able to add new features to it while remaining consistent**
<br><br><br>

**Description:**

This mod turns off the holograms of landing pads, SRV entrance and on foot entrance and can hide the tire tracks of the SRV.
Use this mod to take beautiful screenshots ðŸ¤©

When the '*Show Mod Status*' option is activated, your ship hologram (in the middle of your shield display) turns off to remind you the outer holograms are deactivated (this option is disabled by default)

It is advisable to leave the holograms activated when landing on a station or carrier, otherwise you will not see the location of your pad.
<br><br><br>

**How to use:**

After installing the mod, start the game and press 'F5' to disable holograms.
Press 'F5' again to turn holograms back on.

Press 'SHIFT + F5' to hide tire tracks.
Press again to make them reappear.
<br><br><br>

**Mod hotkeys can be changed :**

*Without EDHM UI:* 

Edit the file 'CleanScreenshots.ini' and change the line: 'Key =no_modifiers F5' or 'Key = SHIFT F5'
