# EDHM Cockpit Paint Mod (CPM)

The Cockpit Paint Mod (CPM) enables CMDRs to paint their cockpits with any combination of colours. You can leave most of the cockpit as default and add a little custom colour, or you can spend a few hours and re-colour every surface. You can even match your cockpit colour scheme with your external paintjob.

The CPM is an extension of the Elite Dangerous HUD Mod (EDHM), so you will need to have EDHM installed first.<br>
The CPM only works with Odyssey / Horizons 4.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some important notes about the CPM:**<br>
• It does not affect the external paintjob or anything ARX-related<br>
• It's client-side only, meaning other players in multi-crew won't see your custom cockpit<br>
• It's purely cosmetic and does not offer any competitive advantage (you can't make panels transparent)<br>
• It doesn't alter any game files (the modding software, 3Dmigoto, sits between the game and the GPU)<br>

The current version of the CPM is only a **prototype** and not the full version. We would like to test a single ship (the Anaconda) to get feedback from the community, and give FDev time to evaluate the mod.

Please note, the CPM complies with the modding rules FDev provided to EDHM in 2020:<br>
_The mod shouldn't provide a competitive advantage, or mod ARX-related assets._

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the files you need for the CPM are available in the folder above (click on the filename, then the Download button is on the right).

Begin with the **CPM Quick Start Guide**, but if you have time I recommend reading the larger Installation and Painting Guides.

As this is a prototype / alpha test, we would greatly appreciate your feedback and suggestions on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) or the [CPM thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/introducing-the-cockpit-paint-mod-cpm.606377/) on the Elite forums

I hope you enjoy the mod!
