# EDHM Cockpit Paint Mod (CPM)

**UPDATE:** CPM v2.0 (public release) is now available!

I'm currently making a video guide, but in the meantime please follow the [CPM Guide](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/blob/main/Odyssey/3rdPartyMods/CockpitPaintMod/CPM-Guide.md)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cockpit Paint Mod (CPM) enables CMDRs to paint their cockpits with any combination of colours. You can leave most of the cockpit as default and add a little custom colour, or you can spend a few hours and re-colour every surface. You can even match your cockpit colour scheme with your external paintjob.

The CPM is an extension of the Elite Dangerous HUD Mod (EDHM), so you will need to have EDHM installed first.<br>
The CPM only works with Odyssey / Horizons 4.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some important notes about the CPM:**<br>
• It does not affect the external paintjob or anything ARX-related<br>
• It's client-side only, meaning other players in multi-crew won't see your custom cockpit<br>
• It's purely cosmetic and does not offer any competitive advantage (you can't make panels transparent)<br>
• It doesn't alter any game files (the modding software, 3Dmigoto, sits between the game and the GPU)<br>

Please note, the CPM complies with the modding rules FDev provided to EDHM in 2020:<br>
_The mod shouldn't provide a competitive advantage, or mod ARX-related assets._
