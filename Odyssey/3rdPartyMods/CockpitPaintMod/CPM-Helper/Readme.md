# CPM Helper v2.1


Note: The app only works in the 'Bordered' or 'Windowed' mode of Elite (in Graphics Settings / Display)

==============================================

The **CPM Helper** is a little app to work with [Blue Mystic's 3rd Party Mod Manager (3PM)](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases), to assist the process of painting your cockpit<br><br>

## Main features of the CPM Helper::

- Dock the 3PM window on top of Elite

- Right-click the mouse or press F11 in the 3PM app, you don't need to switch to Elite to see your changes

    - If CAPS Lock is ON, the 3PM app will be re-focused after a right-click or F11
    - If CAPS Lock is OFF, Elite will be focused after a right-click or F11

- Increase or decrease the opacity of the 3PM window

- CTRL TAB to temporarily hide the 3PM window, CTRL TAB again to unhide

- Press the 'Hide Me' button to hide the Commands window, click the title bar of the Commands window to unhide

- CTRL SPACE or the 'Close CPM Helper' button to Exit the CPM Helper

- On startup, the app checks both Elite and the 3PM windows are open

- On Exit, the app will reset the size and transparency of the 3PM window

- If anything happens (your PC freezes; power goes out; volcano, etc) and the 3PM window is stuck on transparency or hidden mode, either re-run the CPM-Helper app or re-open the 3PM window, and everything will reset back to normal

- If you have trouble starting the app, try running as admin. I haven't had any trouble with it, but every system is different
