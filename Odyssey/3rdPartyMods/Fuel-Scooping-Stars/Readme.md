# Fuel Scooping Stars Mod v1.16.0 for FDev Update 16.01

### by CMDR Fred89210<br><br>

**:: Release Notes ::**
- Ready for FDev U16.01

**Description:**

This mod allows you to modify the colour and luminosity of scoopable stars and non-sequence stars on the galaxy map, **in both Realistic and 'Spectral Type' Filter Mode**.

Scoopable stars and non-sequence stars can be configured separately.

You can also assign hotkeys to quickly enable/disable the mod.

*Important Information*:

In 'Spectral Type' Filter Mode, Class-G Stars cannot be separated from Class-C (Carbon) Stars, because they use exactly the same colour designation.

Class-C Stars are very rare so you probably won't notice, but it may be useful to disable Carbon Stars from the galaxy map filter.
<br><br>

**How to use:**

After installing the mod, open EDHM UI and go to 'Main Menu -> 3PMods -> Fuel Scooping Star Mod'.

Here you can enable/disable the mod, configure colours and assign hotkeys.

Without EDHM UI: Edit the options in the file 'FSStarsMod.ini'
