### FSS Overlay v1.21 by psychicEgg and CMDR Parduz

This is an optional addon for your FSS. The FSS Overlay mod adds an informational overlay on top of the Filtered Spectral Analysis, and tells you what type of celestial bodies fall within a particular frequency band

There are two excellent options for the overlay, designed by CMDR Parduz. You can also adjust the brightness of the overlay.

Good (planet) hunting! o7
