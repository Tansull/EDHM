# FSS Overlay for Odyssey v1.3 
**13 October 2022**

This is an optional addon for your FSS. 

The FSS Overlay mod adds an informational overlay on top of the Filtered Spectral Analysis, and tells you what type of celestial bodies fall within a particular frequency band

There are three options for the overlay, and you can also adjust the brightness/transparency

Good (planet) hunting! o7
