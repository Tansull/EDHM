### EDHM for Odyssey

**ALERT:** EDHM for Odyssey now works in Horizons 4.0! Please see the notes on the [Elite forums thread](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-hud-mod-edhm.557033/post-9946713)
<br><br>
**November 02, 2022:** EDHM for Odyssey / H4.0 v13.51 has been released, please see the [patch notes](https://github.com/psychicEgg/EDHM/blob/main/Odyssey/EDHM%20v13.51%20Patch%20Notes.md)

If you already use the UI, you **do NOT** need to download anything - the next UI update will contain EDHM v13.51 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm very pleased to announce EDHM for Odyssey is now available. Unlike the Horizons version of EDHM, you can set custom RGB colours for every element on the HUD, and ship / station / carrier panels. 

You can also customise the Suit HUD (on-foot). Thanks to CMDR Mystler for modding the Suit HUD!

Due to the complexity of the Odyssey version, I recommend you use EDHM UI (developed by Blue Mystic) to install and configure the mod

[EDHM UI](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI/releases)

Please note: EDHM UI will install both the mod **and** the UI, you don't need to download anything else.

As EDHM for Odyssey is still in development, I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support
