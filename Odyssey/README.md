### EDHM for Odyssey

I'm very pleased to announce EDHM for Odyssey is now available. Unlike the Horizons version of EDHM, you can set custom RGB colours for every element on the HUD, and ship / station / carrier panels. 

In EDHM for Odyssey v8.3 you can now customise the Suit HUD (on-foot). Thanks to CMDR Mystler for modding the Suit HUD!

Due to the complexity of the Odyssey version, I recommend you use EDHM UI (developed by Blue Mystic) to install and configure the mod

Please note: EDHM UI will install both the mod **and** the UI, you don't need to download anything else.

As EDHM for Odyssey is still in development, I recommend you join us on the [EDHM Discord](https://discord.gg/MtBszksjMr) where you can find the latest updates, new player-created themes, and general support
