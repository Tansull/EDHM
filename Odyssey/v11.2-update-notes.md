- Nav panel contacts tab, colour of Team contact bar set to default (blue), was contaminated by XML

- Fixed a few orange multicrew icons (may still be some remaining, I couldn't do extensive tests)
- Landing Coaster Fixed

**v10.1 changelog**

Update notes for v10.1 on this post on the [Elite forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-hud-mod-edhm.557033/post-9742669)

**v10 changelog**

- Fixed the Cabin Lighting for the Beluga

- Fixed the seismic charge mini-game background
  - Generally I'll leave the mining mini-games alone. When we put mods on these elements in Horizons some players chose colours that made the mini-games more difficult, and then complained here ðŸ™‚ So it's best just to leave those mini-games as default

- Fixed Shieldless mode 
  - Setting Shield brightness to 0 no longer makes your target's shield invisible 

- Modded all the orange in the Odyssey settlement terminals

- Separated the Ship Name colour from the Ship Name Background, as they were interlinked before
  - As a result of this change, you may need to reconfigure your ship name settings (but the font should still be the same colour as before)

- Added option to set the colour of mid-HUD cyan text when docking, taking-off, and dropping from supercruise

- Added options for planetary "landed text colour" (not fully custom as it's only a temporary, minor element)

- Changed description of custom Icon colour as it actually affects many more icons than just icons on the Nav panel

- Added options to remove colour protection by category:
  - Bright Yellow (I usually set this to Off)
  - General Yellow
  - White
  - Green
  - Red
  - Cyan
  - SuperPowers / Powers Icon colours (if OFF, will show default Elite, unless orange then it will colour the icons with your XML, as has always been previously)

Be careful turning off Red and Cyan, they're the most common indicators in Elite. White and Green only have a few appearances.
