## EDHM for Odyssey v8.4

The 'small things' update

This update adds a few minor details to EDHM for Odyssey. I wanted to get it out prior to FDev Update 9 so we can test these additions, and if any bugs are found I can include a fix with the EDHM 9.0 update (which will likely be about 8 to 10 days from now)

**If you use EDHM UI, please do NOT download and install this zip file. Wait for Blue Mystic to update the UI, which will include this update soon. Thank you!**

============================================

Changelog for EDHM for Odyssey v8.4

• Speeding Warning, custom colours for the bars (Note: I can't change the text colour here)

• Remote release Flechette / Flac launcher custom colours (Note: I can't change the red trigger signal yet, it's in a different shader)

• Fixed the FDev bug that sometimes shows the Flechette / Flac reticle on the SRV

• Added colour options for the rank icon that appears when you target a new neutral ship (previously it used the XML colour)

• Added custom colour options for the 'grey rhombus' - the grey square-thing that shows selectable objects in the environment

• Modded the Wing / Team hull bars to XML

• Fixed the thargoid caustic effect on your ship's hull bars. You can choose a custom colour or the yellow/green Elite colour.

• Fixed the Ship Name text (top right) when your main text colour is green (the ship name was missing a green channel)
    -- Note: adding the green channel back in will make your Ship Name text a bit brighter, and you may need to adjust it back down

• Added an option to reduce the brightness of the 'Ship Secured' blue text when landing on a planet. It looks very blown out in unmodded Elite

• Fixed contamination of the missile lock animation by another shader (it was stuck on XML but should use your Custom colour now)
