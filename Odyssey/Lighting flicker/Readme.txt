If you have an AMD graphics card you may experience flickering with the new lighting shader

To fix:

1. Download the zip file from this folder (EDHM Odyssey 8.2 - Lighting fail-safe.zip)

2. Exit Elite

3. Go into the ShaderFixes folder in the Odyssey game folder 

Disable the lighting shader by putting a dash in front of the filename, like this -ffe7f55eadedff2d-ps.txt

4. And then extract the new shader from the zip file into the ShaderFixes folder, then restart Elite

It won't have the new features of reducing skin contamination but hopefully the flickering will stop
