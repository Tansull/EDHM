## EDHM for Odyssey v9.1

Hi CMDRs,

Many of you have been waiting for Night Vision and Orbit Lines to be included in the main mod, so here they are!

v9.1 Changelog:

• Supercruise sidelines can now be modded with Custom or XML colour (or you can still turn them off)

• Orbit Lines added
Please remember the Orbit Lines in Odyssey tend to turn off more randomly than Horizons - it's not a fault with the mod (it depends on your supercruise speed and angle)

• Night vision added (thanks to CMDR Jessidhia)

• Intro screens on the monitors in the concourse should correctly show your XML and text colours
